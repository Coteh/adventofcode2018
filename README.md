# adventofcode2018

This is the first year I did Advent of Code. I used Go for this challenge, as I was learning Go at the time.

## Instructions

To compile and run:

```sh
go run 01/01.go

# pass in input file directly

go run 01/01.go < 01/input
```

Alternatively, the programs can be compiled then run directly:

```sh
go build 01/01 01/01/go
```

Then once it's compiled, can simply run using:

```sh
./01/01

# pass in input file directly

./01/01 < 01/input
```

\* Output has to be verified manually at the moment. See TODO comment in `./10/test.sh` for more info.

\** Day 11 part 2 is incredibly slow at the moment. Will need to see if it can be optimized later.
